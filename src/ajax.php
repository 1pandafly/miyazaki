                            reach for someone who reaches for their dreams. Miyazaki has specialized over the years in
                            flight; from moving castles to witches soaring through the air. He then attempted to finish
                            his career with the true story of a man who dreamed of flying and with it, Miyazaki might
                            have created the most spectacular flying animations of his career.</p>
